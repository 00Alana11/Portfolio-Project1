# Spotify Artists Analysis-Portfolio-Projects
The aim of this project is to analyze the differences or similarities in the music that different artists produce on spotify. The focus will be placed on extracting the musical taste of 50 different artists from a wide range of genres. Throughout the process, I also identified different artists that share a similar musical style.

In this project, I accessed the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), which provides data from the Spotify music catalog and can be accesed via standard HTTPS requests to an API endpoint. The Spotify API provides, among other things, track information for each song, including audio statistics such as instrumentalness, danceability or tempo. I focused on retrieving this audio feature information from 50 different 'This Is' Playlists of 50 different artists. Each feature measures an aspect of a song. Detailed information on how each feature is calculated can be found in the Spotify API Website.
